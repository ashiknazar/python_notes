    "## `if`, `elif`, and `else` Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python are used for decision-making, enabling you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the code inside the `if` block is executed. If the condition is `False`, the code in the `if` block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement is used to specify a block of code that will execute if the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`. It provides an alternative when the `if` condition is not met. The `else` block is optional and is used when no other conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `elif` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement is used to check additional conditions when the initial `if` condition is `False`. If the `elif` condition evaluates to `True`, its block of code is executed. You can have multiple `elif` statements to test different conditions in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **`if`**: Tests a condition and executes the block if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **`elif`**: Checks additional conditions if the `if` condition is `False`. You can have multiple `elif` statements.\n",
    "- **`else`**: Executes a block of code if all preceding conditions (`if` and `elif`) are `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nesting `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to nest `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements inside each other to create more complex decision-making logic. Nested conditions allow for more detailed and specific checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- `if-else` and `elif` statements are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions.\n",
    "- Use `if` for the first condition, `elif` for additional conditions, and `else` as a fallback when no conditions are met.\n"
