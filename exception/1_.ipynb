    "# Understanding Exceptions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are events that can disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exception occurs, Python stops executing the current block of code and looks for an exception handler to resolve the issue. If no handler is found, the program terminates with a traceback message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is an Exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an error that occurs at runtime, disrupting the normal flow of execution. Common causes of exceptions include invalid inputs, missing files, or dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1 / 0  # This raises a ZeroDivisionError\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## 2. Types of Exceptions\n",
    "Python provides a variety of built-in exceptions, each related to specific types of errors. Some common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when dividing by zero.\n",
    "- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when trying to open a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list.\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Handling Exceptions\n",
    "Python provides mechanisms to handle exceptions using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `try` Block\n",
    "The code inside the `try` block is executed first. If no exception occurs, the `except` block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may cause an exception\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Handle the exception\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### `except` Block\n",
    "If an exception occurs inside the `try` block, Python checks the exception type and looks for an appropriate `except` block to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(\"hello\")  # Will raise ValueError\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### `else` Block\n",
    "The else block is executed if no exception was raised in the `try` block. It’s optional and typically used for code that should run only when the `try` block is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `finally` Block\n",
    "The `finally block`, if present, is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always run!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 4. Raising Exceptions\n",
    "Python also allows you to raise exceptions manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to signal an error under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Catching Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple `except` blocks or a single except block that catches multiple exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / x\n",
    "except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 6. Custom Exceptions\n",
    "You can create your own exceptions by subclassing the built-in Exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise MyCustomError(\"Something went wrong!\")\n",
    "except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n"
