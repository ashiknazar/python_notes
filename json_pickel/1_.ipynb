    "### Pickle and JSON with `open()` and `close()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **Pickle** and **JSON** serialization methods require working with file operations such as opening and closing files to store and retrieve serialized data. The process for both is essentially the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening a file**: You open a file in the appropriate mode (`'wb'` for Pickle binary mode, `'w'` for JSON text mode) to write, or `'rb'` and `'r'` to read.\n",
    "2. **Writing and reading data**: You use `pickle.dump()` or `json.dump()` to write serialized data to the file, and `pickle.load()` or `json.load()` to read and deserialize data back.\n",
    "3. **Closing the file**: After the operation, you should always close the file using `file.close()` to ensure proper file handling and resource release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates the similarity between Pickle and JSON handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pickle Example\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "file = open('data.pkl', 'wb')  # Open file in binary write mode\n",
    "pickle.dump(my_object, file)    # Serialize and write the object to the file\n",
    "file.close()                    # Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# JSON Example\n",
    "import json\n",
    "file = open('data.json', 'w')   # Open file in text write mode\n",
