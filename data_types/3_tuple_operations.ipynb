    "# Python Tuple Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tuple** in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed once created, making them useful for storing data that should not be modified. Tuples can contain elements of different data types, and they support many operations similar to lists, though with certain restrictions due to their immutability. Below is a comprehensive guide to the various operations that can be performed on tuples in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Creating a Tuple**\n",
    "   - **Empty Tuple**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     empty_tuple = ()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Tuple with Elements**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Tuple with Mixed Data Types**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     mixed_tuple = (1, \"hello\", 3.14, True)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Tuple with a Single Element**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     single_element_tuple = (5,)  # Note the comma\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Accessing Tuple Elements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 **Indexing**\n",
    "   - Access an element by its index (starts from 0):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     element = my_tuple[2]  # Accesses the third element, Result: 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 **Negative Indexing**\n",
    "   - Access an element from the end of the tuple:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     element = my_tuple[-1]  # Accesses the last element, Result: 5\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 **Slicing**\n",
    "   - Retrieve a subtuple (from `start` index to `end` index):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     subtuple = my_tuple[1:4]  # Result: (2, 3, 4)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Modifying Tuples**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since tuples are **immutable**, elements of a tuple cannot be changed after its creation. However, you can perform operations that result in a new tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 **Concatenation**\n",
    "   - Combine two tuples:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "     tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "     concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2  # Result: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 **Repetition**\n",
    "   - Repeat a tuple multiple times:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     repeated_tuple = (1, 2, 3) * 3  # Result: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 **Converting to a List**\n",
    "   - If you need to modify a tuple, convert it to a list, modify the list, and convert it back to a tuple:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = list(my_tuple)  # Convert tuple to list\n",
    "     my_list[1] = 10           # Modify list\n",
    "     modified_tuple = tuple(my_list)  # Convert list back to tuple\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Tuple Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 **Tuple Length**\n",
    "   - Get the number of elements in a tuple:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     length = len(my_tuple)  # Returns the number of elements in my_tuple\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 **Checking Membership**\n",
    "   - Check if an element exists in the tuple:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     exists = 3 in my_tuple  # Returns True if 3 is in my_tuple\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 **Counting Elements**\n",
    "   - **Count** the occurrences of an element in the tuple:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     count = my_tuple.count(2)  # Returns the number of times 2 appears in my_tuple\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 **Finding Index**\n",
    "   - **Index** of the first occurrence of an element:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     index = my_tuple.index(3)  # Returns the index of the first occurrence of 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Tuple Iteration**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can iterate through a tuple using a `for` loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "       print(item)\n"
