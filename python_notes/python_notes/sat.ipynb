    "# Task: Test Public, Protected, and Private Variables in Python with Classes and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "- Implement a library management system using classes in Python.\n",
    "- Demonstrate the use of **public**, **protected**, and **private** variables.\n",
    "- Use inheritance to showcase variable access and behavior across class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create the `Library` Class\n",
    "1. Define a `Library` class with:\n",
    "   - A **public variable** `library_name` to store the name of the library.\n",
    "   - A **protected variable** `_total_books` to store the total number of books in the library.\n",
    "   - A **private variable** `__admin_password` to store the admin password (accessible only within the `Library` class).\n",
    "2. Add methods:\n",
    "   - `add_books(count)`: A **public method** to add books to the library and update `_total_books`.\n",
    "   - `_verify_admin(password)`: A **protected method** to check if the given password matches the admin password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create the `Member` Class\n",
    "1. Define a `Member` class that inherits from the `Library` class.\n",
    "2. Add a **public variable** `member_name` to store the name of the member.\n",
    "3. Implement a method:\n",
    "   - `borrow_book(password, num_books=1)`: A **public method** that:\n",
    "     - Uses the `_verify_admin()` method from the `Library` class to check if the admin password is correct.\n",
    "     - Decreases `_total_books` by the number of books borrowed if the password is valid and enough books are available.\n",
    "     - Displays appropriate messages for success or failure scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Test the Classes\n",
    "1. Create an instance of the `Library` class with:\n",
    "   - A library name of your choice.\n",
    "   - An admin password (e.g., `\"secure123\"`).\n",
    "2. Test the `add_books()` method to add books to the library.\n",
    "3. Attempt to access the protected (`_total_books`) and private (`__admin_password`) variables directly and observe the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create an instance of the `Member` class with:\n",
    "   - The library name.\n",
    "   - The same admin password.\n",
    "   - A member name of your choice.\n",
    "5. Use the `borrow_book()` method to:\n",
    "   - Borrow books with the correct admin password.\n",
    "   - Attempt to borrow books with an incorrect admin password.\n",
    "   - Try to borrow more books than available and verify the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "1. Public variables are accessible directly and can be modified without restrictions.\n",
    "2. Protected variables can be accessed in subclasses but should not be accessed directly outside the class hierarchy (though technically possible).\n",
    "3. Private variables enforce encapsulation and are not accessible outside the defining class.\n",
    "4. The `borrow_book()` method demonstrates the interaction of public, protected, and private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Challenge\n",
    "Modify the `Library` class to add:\n",
    "- A method `get_total_books()` that returns the value of `_total_books`.\n",
    "- A method `change_admin_password(old_password, new_password)` to safely update the admin password if the old password is correct.\n"
