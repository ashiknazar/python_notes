    "# JSON Dump vs. Pickle Dump: A Comprehensive Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. JSON Dump\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data interchange format that is text-based and human-readable. It is language-agnostic, meaning it can be used across various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- When using `json.dump()`, the Python objects must be **JSON-serializable**. This means that the objects should consist of basic data types such as:\n",
    "  - **`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, `bool`, `None`**\n",
    "- Custom objects must be manually converted into a serializable format, such as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- JSON cannot handle complex Python objects like functions, classes, or instances of custom objects directly.\n",
    "- **Custom serialization** is required for objects that do not natively map to JSON-compatible structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "with open('data.json', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    json.dump(data, f)\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Best for:\n",
    "Data interchange between different programming languages.\n",
    "Storing simple data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) in a human-readable format.\n",
    "Security: Safe for storing data, as it does not execute code during serialization or deserialization."

    "## 2. Pickle Dump\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- Pickle is a Python-specific serialization format that converts Python objects into a binary format. It supports a wide range of Python objects, including custom classes, functions, and instances of complex data structures.\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- `pickle.dump()` can serialize nearly all Python objects, such as:\n",
    "  - Classes, functions, custom objects, and complex data structures (e.g., numpy arrays).\n",
    "- Pickle handles more complex objects, and does not require manual conversion of custom types into serializable structures.\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- Python-specific: Pickle data is not portable across languages and can only be deserialized by Python programs.\n",
    "- Security risk: Unpickling data from untrusted sources can execute arbitrary code, posing a potential security risk.\n",
    "Example:"
